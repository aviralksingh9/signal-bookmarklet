## What It Does

Signal analyzes the visible structure of any webpage in real time and presents structural intelligence in a calm side panel.

It evaluates:

- Page intent (Informational, Transactional, Marketing)
- Content depth
- Commercial pressure
- Structural segmentation
- Cognitive load
- Authority bias
- Emotional intensity
- Live reading behavior

It does not modify the page.  
It does not remove content.  
It does not inject heavy styles.  

It analyzes and informs.

## Why It’s Useful

Modern webpages are engineered for engagement, persuasion, and conversion.

Signal restores awareness.

It helps you understand:

- What a page is trying to make you do
- How dense or shallow the content is
- Whether persuasive pressure is present
- How cognitively heavy the page feels
- Whether you are deeply reading or just scanning

All without leaving the page.

## How It Works

The bookmarklet:

1. Extracts visible page text
2. Analyzes structural distribution (paragraphs, headings, links, buttons)
3. Computes weighted heuristic scores
4. Classifies page intent
5. Estimates persuasion and friction metrics
6. Tracks scroll behavior to determine reading mode
7. Renders a fixed intelligence panel
8. Removes all listeners and restores layout on exit

No backend.  
No APIs.  
No external scripts.
